How To Use This Repo
-----------------------

Follow these directions closely to switch over to this repository.

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork to your ```~/my_projects``` folder.
3. Create a directory in the ```BEWD_SF_12_homework``` folder using your real name and github account name, like ```BEWD_SF_12_homework/ChristineLau-chylaudes```. That will make it easier for us to remember who everyone's github name is. :)

Example of what your folders should look something like:

~/projects/BEWD_SF_12_homework/ChristineLau-chylaude/hw_1/whatever_it_is.rb
```
